A modern clavinet design &amp; its digital twin

Innovators like Leo Fender imbued the electric guitar with flexibility at a price-point that enabled a several subsequent decades of musical development.  The electromechanical pianos of the mid 20th century introduced new sounds as well, but many factors (including complexity & cost) kept them from displacing the acoustic piano as completely as the electric guitar did for its arched hollow predecessors.  The advent of the ROM-based electronic keyboards in the 1980's dropped keyboard manufacturing costs by an order of magnitude while also bringing more convincing piano sounds to consumers.  As a result, nearly all remaining electromechanical keyboard instruments are refurbished holdovers from the 1950's to 1970's.  

Our intepretation of sound will always be rooted in the physical world, though.  And the vibrating string is the musical archetype.  With that motivation, I seek here to design an instrument modeled after the Clavinet with the following goals:

-Portable (target weight of 50 lbs or less)

-Affordable (bill of materials costing hundreds, not thousands)

-Low-cost manufacturing (target labor of less than 2 person-days)

-Re-use of commerically available materials where possible

-Parametric CAD scripts, to ease customization

-Explore collaborative design with AI LLM's
